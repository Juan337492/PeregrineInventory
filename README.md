# Inventory Management App - README

## Summary
The Inventory Management App is designed to streamline inventory tracking processes for businesses of all sizes. It aims to address user needs related to efficient inventory management, user authentication, database integration, and SMS notification capabilities. The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to manage their inventory effectively, ensuring accurate tracking and timely notifications for low stock levels or important events.

## Screens and Features
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app includes screens and features such as:

- **Login Screen:** Allows users to securely log in to their accounts or create new ones.
- **Dashboard:** Displays an overview of inventory items, upcoming events, and notifications.
- **Inventory Management:** Enables users to add, edit, and delete inventory items, as well as view detailed information.
- **SMS Notifications:** Provides optional SMS notifications for low inventory levels or upcoming events.

These UI designs prioritize simplicity, intuitiveness, and accessibility to ensure a positive user experience. Users can easily accomplish their tasks without confusion or frustration by incorporating clear navigation, logical layout, and intuitive controls.

## Coding Approach
I employed techniques such as modular programming and MVC architecture in coding the app. These strategies promote code reusability and maintainability. Additionally, I followed best practices for clean coding, code documentation, and error handling to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Testing Process
I conducted rigorous testing such as unit tests and running the app on my mobile phone. This process was crucial for identifying and fixing bugs, ensuring the app behaves as expected, and delivering a reliable product to end-users. Testing revealed issues such as login authentication failures and database synchronization errors, which were promptly addressed to enhance the app's performance and stability.

## Innovation and Challenges
One notable challenge during development was implementing real-time SMS notifications while ensuring user privacy and permission handling. Overcoming this required a deep understanding of Android development, API integration, and user privacy rules.

## Demonstrated Knowledge and Skills
The successful implementation of user authentication and database integration components showcased my knowledge and skills in backend development and API integration. By designing a robust and secure authentication system and seamlessly integrating database operations, I demonstrated proficiency in full-stack development and delivering scalable, reliable applications.
